## **Method of complements 补语法**
>In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

## **Byte 字节**
>The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

## **Integer (computer science) 整数（计算机科学）**
>In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.

## **Floating point 浮点数**
>In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times

2) x=-15，占8位。二进制是(**11110001**)，八进制是(**361**)。<br>

3) 1
* x转十进制是(**-31**),在内存中占了1 byte，<br>
* 二进制是(**1110 0001**)<br>
* 十六进制为(**0xe1**). 而y占4 bytes, 在进行赋值计算时x会自动变为4 bytes，并用符号位的数字补位，即为(**1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 0001**)<br>
* 十进制是<b>-31</b><br>
* 十六进制是(**0xffffffe1**).

3) 2
基为b，x表示为b进制a0a1a2a3，以4位为例x = ((a0 * b + a1) * b + a2) * b + a3a3 = x % bx / b = ((a0 * b + a1) * b + a2)这样继续做下去就可以了。到a0那儿可以看成是(0 * b + a0) * b，也就是商为0时终止。

4) ## NAH 非数
In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.
